  - [ ] Document which configurations were preserved vs deleted in each scenario
- [ ] Task 2: Compare with existing analysis (AC: 2, 3)
  - [ ] Review docs/ideas/nix-gc-removes-current-settings/06-summary.md
  - [ ] Identify which hypotheses from the analysis were confirmed
  - [ ] Document any unexpected behaviors not covered in original analysis
  - [ ] Note any additional root causes discovered during testing
- [ ] Task 3: Create visual documentation (AC: 4)
  - [ ] Include screenshots of P10k wizard if it appeared
  - [ ] Create directory tree diagrams showing before/after GC states
  - [ ] Include relevant log excerpts highlighting permission errors
  - [ ] Add terminal output showing the bug in action
- [ ] Task 4: Write comprehensive postmortem (AC: 1, 5)
  - [ ] Create docs/stories/epic-1-postmortem.md
  - [ ] Include executive summary of findings
  - [ ] Document confirmed root cause with evidence
  - [ ] Provide detailed timeline of bug occurrence
  - [ ] List all affected files and configurations
  - [ ] Verify report completeness against checklist (see below)
- [ ] Task 5: Create QA validation guide (AC: 5)
  - [ ] Write step-by-step reproduction instructions
  - [ ] Include exact commands to trigger the bug
  - [ ] Document expected vs actual behavior
  - [ ] Provide checklist for validating the fix in Epic 2
  - [ ] Include rollback procedures if needed

## Report Completeness Criteria

### Postmortem Report Checklist

The bug reproduction report must include all of the following sections to be considered complete:

1. **Executive Summary** (1-2 paragraphs)
   - [ ] Clear statement of the bug
   - [ ] Impact on users
   - [ ] Confirmed root cause (if identified)

2. **Test Methodology**
   - [ ] Tools and commands used
   - [ ] Test environment details (OS version, Nix versions)
   - [ ] Isolation measures taken

3. **Results Summary Table**
   - [ ] Comparison of baseline, manual GC, and launchd GC states
   - [ ] Clear pass/fail indicators for each test
   - [ ] Key differences highlighted

4. **Root Cause Evidence**
   - [ ] Specific errors or behaviors that confirm hypothesis
   - [ ] Permission context differences documented
   - [ ] GC root directory states before/after

5. **Visual Documentation**
   - [ ] Screenshots of P10k wizard (if triggered)
   - [ ] Directory tree diagrams
   - [ ] Relevant log excerpts with timestamps

6. **Reproduction Steps**
   - [ ] Numbered step-by-step instructions
   - [ ] Exact commands to run
   - [ ] Expected outcomes at each step

7. **New Discoveries**
   - [ ] Any findings not in original analysis
   - [ ] Unexpected behaviors documented
   - [ ] Additional root causes identified

8. **Recommendations**
   - [ ] Specific fixes to implement in Epic 2
   - [ ] Priority ordering if multiple issues found
   - [ ] Risk assessment for each fix

### Example Report Structure

```markdown
# Epic 1 Bug Reproduction Postmortem

## Executive Summary
The weekly GC bug was successfully reproduced...

## Test Methodology
Tests were conducted on macOS 14.5 with nix-darwin version...

## Results Summary
| Test Scenario | Terminal Configs | P10k Wizard | GC Roots | Notes |
|---------------|------------------|-------------|----------|--------|
| Baseline      | ✓ Present        | No          | ✓ Valid  | Working state |
| Manual GC     | ✓ Preserved      | No          | ✓ Valid  | No issues |
| Launchd GC    | ✗ Deleted        | Yes         | ✗ Missing| Bug reproduced |

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

- Story 1.1: Captured baseline working state
- Story 1.2: Tested manual GC (expected to preserve configs)
- Story 1.3: Tested launchd GC (expected to reproduce the bug)

### Technical Analysis Reference

For comprehensive technical analysis and root cause findings, see: [`docs/ideas/nix-gc-removes-current-settings/06-summary.md`](../../ideas/nix-gc-removes-current-settings/06-summary.md)

### Report Structure

The postmortem should follow this structure:

1. **Executive Summary** - One paragraph overview of findings
2. **Test Methodology** - How tests were conducted
3. **Results Summary** - Table comparing all three states
4. **Root Cause Confirmation** - Evidence supporting the hypothesis
5. **New Discoveries** - Any findings not in original analysis
6. **Visual Evidence** - Screenshots, logs, diagrams
7. **Reproduction Steps** - Clear instructions for QA
8. **Recommendations** - Input for Epic 2 implementation

### Key Comparisons to Document

Critical items to compare across all three states:

- Existence of /nix/var/nix/gcroots/per-user/$USER/
- State of GC roots in /nix/var/nix/gcroots/auto/
- Presence of ~/.config/zsh/ files
- P10k wizard triggering
- Generation counts before/after
- Permission errors in logs
- Execution context differences

### Technical Analysis Focus

The report should provide clear evidence for:

- Why launchd GC fails but manual GC succeeds
- Which specific GC roots are missing or misconfigured
- How permission context affects GC behavior
- Why Home Manager profiles are specifically affected

### QA Validation Requirements

The QA guide should enable someone unfamiliar with the issue to:

- Set up a test environment
- Reproduce the bug reliably
- Verify the bug exists before applying fixes
- Test the fix implementation from Epic 2
- Confirm the fix resolves all aspects of the issue

### Testing Standards

- All findings must be evidence-based (logs, screenshots, file listings)
- Reproduction steps must be tested and verified
- Report should be technical but accessible to all team members
- Include version information for all components
- Maintain professional documentation standards
