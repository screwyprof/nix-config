# BMad v4.35.3 Usage Feedback (WIP)

**Disclaimer:** This is a case study, not a critique. Solo developer exploring `BMad` for bug troubleshooting on a personal project - probably using it in ways the authors never imagined! ðŸ˜„

**Project:** Personal [nix-config](https://github.com/happygopher/nix-config)  
**Branch:** [`fix/nix-gc-removes-current-settings`](https://github.com/screwyprof/nix-config/tree/fix/nix-gc-removes-current-settings)
**Status:** Work in Progress - Bug reproduced but not yet fixed.

## Summary

Used `BMad` for bug investigation in existing codebase. Elicitation techniques exceptional, but framework assumptions created friction requiring manual workarounds.

## Context

Solo developer exploring `BMad` by applying it to a real troubleshooting task: weekly garbage collection removes current user settings in `nix-config`.

## The Journey

### Pre-BMad Analysis

Created [`docs/ideas/nix-gc-removes-current-settings/06-summary.md`](https://github.com/screwyprof/nix-config/blob/fix/nix-gc-removes-current-settings/docs/ideas/nix-gc-removes-current-settings/06-summary.md) with 440+ (Don't even ask why. Just was playing around with LLMs which is another story...) pages of analysis from multiple LLMs.

**Pro Bono:** Could have used `Analyst` agent's brainstorming and web research capabilities at this stage.

### Analyst (Mary) - Brief Creation

Discovered exceptionally powerful elicitation techniques - one of the **best personal findings in recent years** for requirements gathering.

**First limitation:** Brief hardcoded to `docs/brief.md` ([`bmad-core/templates/project-brief-tmpl.yaml#L7`](https://github.com/bmad-code-org/BMAD-METHOD/tree/v4.35.3/bmad-core/templates/project-brief-tmpl.yaml#L7))

**Second observation:** `Mary` created 500+ page brief from 440+ page summary. A brief should be brief - had to intervene to create proper executive summary that references supporting documents.

**Workaround:** Created feature-specific brief at [`docs/briefs/nix-gc-removes-current-settings.md`](https://github.com/screwyprof/nix-config/blob/fix/nix-gc-removes-current-settings/docs/briefs/nix-gc-removes-current-settings.md)

### PM (John) - PRD Creation

**Pattern confirmed:** PRD hardcoded to `docs/prd.md` ([`bmad-core/core-config.yaml#L3`](https://github.com/bmad-code-org/BMAD-METHOD/tree/v4.35.3/bmad-core/core-config.yaml#L3))

**Further restriction:** Sharding only splits large files, doesn't enable feature-based PRDs.

**Applied same approach:** Created feature-specific PRD at [`docs/prd/nix-gc-removes-current-settings.md`](https://github.com/screwyprof/nix-config/blob/fix/nix-gc-removes-current-settings/docs/prd/nix-gc-removes-current-settings.md)

**Note:** `PM` correctly created phased epics as part of PRD ([Epic 1](https://github.com/screwyprof/nix-config/blob/fix/nix-gc-removes-current-settings/docs/prd/nix-gc-removes-current-settings.md#epic-1-bug-reproduction--root-cause-validation) for bug reproduction, Epic 2 for fix implementation)

**Key problem discovered:** PRD template assumes immediate handoff to `Architect` ([`bmad-core/templates/prd-tmpl.yaml#L202`](https://github.com/bmad-code-org/BMAD-METHOD/tree/v4.35.3/bmad-core/templates/prd-tmpl.yaml#L202)). But for this bug investigation, you can't design architecture before reproducing the bug itself!

**Decision:** Skip `Architect` for now, go directly to `SM` for investigation stories.

**Enhancements made to PRD:**

1. Added Source Brief reference (template doesn't include this)
2. Added analysis document link in Background Context  
3. Deferred architecture - added custom "Architect Prompt (To be used AFTER Dev completes Epic 1)" section

### SM (Scrum Master) - Story Creation

**Major limitation:** Stories created with generic names:

- `/stories/1.1.story.md`
- `/stories/1.2.story.md`

**Impact:** Can't identify feature from filename with multiple features in development.

**Technical cause:**

- Template defines: `{{epic_num}}.{{story_num}}.{{story_title_short}}.md` ([`bmad-core/templates/story-tmpl.yaml#L7`](https://github.com/bmad-code-org/BMAD-METHOD/tree/v4.35.3/bmad-core/templates/story-tmpl.yaml#L7))
- Implementation hardcodes: `{epicNum}.{storyNum}.story.md` ([`bmad-core/tasks/create-next-story.md#L78`](https://github.com/bmad-code-org/BMAD-METHOD/tree/v4.35.3/bmad-core/tasks/create-next-story.md#L78))

**Coordination gap:** No central coordination point between agents for current feature/task. Since we skipped `Architect`, there was no handoff context for `SM`. Architecture template mentions "Begin story implementation with Dev agent" but has no specific `SM handoff prompt`.

**Another manual addition:** Added [`SM Prompt`](https://github.com/screwyprof/nix-config/blob/fix/nix-gc-removes-current-settings/docs/prd/nix-gc-removes-current-settings.md#sm-prompt) to PRD to provide context for story creation.

**Scoped approach:** Instructed `SM` to create stories only for `Epic 1` (Bug Reproduction). With `Architect` already skipped, didn't want to risk confusion by asking for all epics. Baby steps approach - first reproduce the bug, then see how agents handle just that part.

### PO (Product Owner) - Validation

PO validated all stories and generated report.

**Critical discovery:** PO validation has no workflow impact:

- `validate-next-story` task only generates GO/NO-GO report
- Story template lists only `scrum-master` and `dev-agent` as editors ([`bmad-core/templates/story-tmpl.yaml#L31`](https://github.com/bmad-code-org/BMAD-METHOD/tree/v4.35.3/bmad-core/templates/story-tmpl.yaml#L31))
- No agent references PO's work
- Validation report sits in isolation

**The status problem:**

1. SM creates stories with Status: Draft ([`bmad-core/tasks/create-next-story.md#L79`](https://github.com/bmad-code-org/BMAD-METHOD/tree/v4.35.3/bmad-core/tasks/create-next-story.md#L79))
2. PO validates but can't change status (not listed as editor)
3. Dev won't work on Draft stories - workflow blocked
4. SM has nothing like `*approve-story` command
5. Manual intervention required to ask SM to approve or dev to ignore the status.

**Workaround:** Manually asked SM to update statuses to "Approved"

**Additional PRD additions:**

- [`PO Prompt (After SM creates stories)`](https://github.com/screwyprof/nix-config/blob/fix/nix-gc-removes-current-settings/docs/prd/nix-gc-removes-current-settings.md#po-prompt-after-sm-creates-stories)
- [`Dev Prompt (After PO approves Epic 1 stories)`](https://github.com/screwyprof/nix-config/blob/fix/nix-gc-removes-current-settings/docs/prd/nix-gc-removes-current-settings.md#dev-prompt-after-po-approves-epic-1-stories)

### Dev (James) - Implementation Journey

Dev agent activated after `SM` approved stories.

**Critical Error 1:** Wrong Story Selection

When given just `*develop-story` with no arguments, Dev agent arbitrarily picked `story 1.4` without:

- Checking if there were unimplemented stories before it (there were - 1.1, 1.2, 1.3)
- Following any logical order (should start with 1.1)
- Asking which story to work on when no argument provided

**Critical Error 2:** Ignoring Technical Analysis

`Story 1.1` specifically referenced the technical analysis document:

- "For comprehensive technical analysis and root cause findings, see: [`docs/ideas/nix-gc-removes-current-settings/06-summary.md`](../../ideas/nix-gc-removes-current-settings/06-summary.md)"

However, Dev agent completely ignored this critical link and proceeded without reading it. This led to:

- Missing important context about `useUserPackages` behavior
- Not understanding the root cause hypothesis
- Implementing the story without full understanding

**Critical Error 3:** Home Manager Command Assumption

Dev agent tried to run `home-manager generations` even though:

- The technical analysis clearly stated Home Manager is integrated as a nix-darwin module
- There is no standalone `home-manager` command in this setup
- Agent should have checked the `flake.nix` architecture first

**Critical Error 4:** Checklist Execution Failure

Dev agent's own workflow documentation states:

> "run the task execute-checklist for the checklist story-dod-checklist"

What the agent actually did:

1. Acknowledged the checklist requirement in workflow
2. But then tried to mark all tasks complete WITHOUT running the checklist
3. I blocked completion and asked WHY checklist wasn't run
4. Agent couldn't execute it because `execute-checklist` wasn't in its commands
5. I had to ask WHO should run it - agent had to search to discover it was its own responsibility
6. Only then did agent manually read and process the checklist

**Root Cause Analysis:**

1. **Command parsing issue** - Agent doesn't properly parse story filenames from commands
2. **Link following failure** - Agent skips important reference documents
3. **Assumption over verification** - Agent makes assumptions instead of checking the actual system
4. **Incomplete agent configuration** - Agent's available commands don't include all required tasks

**Impact:**

- I had to correct agent multiple times
- Wasted effort on wrong approaches
- Missed critical findings initially
- Inefficient workflow requiring manual intervention

**Recommendations for Dev Agent:**

1. Parse commands correctly - when given a specific story, work on THAT story
2. Always follow and read linked technical documents
3. Verify system architecture before making assumptions
4. Include `execute-checklist` in available commands
5. Run DoD checklist as part of standard completion workflow

### Dev Agent - Story 1.2 Command Execution Failure

**Critical Error:** Fabricated Data When Command Failed

During Story 1.2 implementation, when asked to check disk usage with `nix-store-size`:

1. **Correct behavior:** Found command was an alias to `du -sh /nix/store`
2. **Attempted execution:** Ran the expanded command, but it timed out after 2 minutes
3. **WRONG response:** Instead of admitting failure, used `df -h /nix` output showing 160GB partition usage
4. **Presented as fact:** Reported "Current Nix store usage: 160GB" as if command succeeded
5. **My correction:** I showed actual output: `54G /nix/store`
6. **Magnitude of error:** Reported 3x the actual size by using wrong data source

**Root Cause:** When primary method failed, substituted unrelated data instead of acknowledging failure

**Note:** This appears to be a Claude Code AI agent issue rather than BMad-specific, but documenting as it occurred during BMad workflow

### Dev Agent - Story 1.3 Implementation

> "You're absolutely right! I got distracted by the investigation and forgot the main goal - to actually reproduce the bug." - Dev Agent

#### Discovery 1: Lost Focus on Primary Goal

During `Story 1.3` investigation (in a fresh session with minimal context), Dev agent became so engrossed in technical analysis that the main objective was forgotten. Spent extensive time analyzing permission models and GC behaviors instead of focusing on reproducing the bug. After my intervention, successfully refocused and reproduced the bug.

**Note:** This focus loss might be a `Claude Code` or LLM characteristic rather than `BMad`-specific

#### Discovery 2: Self-Contained Investigation Reports

Story 1.3 also revealed a helpful documentation approach:

1. **Initial approach:** Created evidence in temp directories (e.g., `temp/launchd-gc/analysis.txt`)
2. **Problem identified:** Temp file references become invalid when cleaned
3. **Better approach:** Created separate self-contained investigation reports alongside story files
4. **Example created:** `docs/stories/1.3-investigation-report.md` (310 lines with complete evidence)
5. **Pattern:** Story remains clean task definition; detailed findings go in companion report file
6. **Benefit:** Future developers have permanent access to investigation details without cluttering stories

**Personal preference discovered:** I found it helpful to create permanent investigation reports alongside stories, but this raises bigger questions about documentation in AI workflows.

**The documentation dilemma:** Where's the balance between:

- Quick temp files that get the job done but disappear
- Capturing the essence without re-inventing Confluence/Jira
- Just enough artifacts for AI agents to maintain context

This isn't a `BMad` issue - it's a fundamental question about how much documentation is "just right" for AI-assisted development. Different projects and people will have different answers.

#### Suggestions Based on My Experience

1. Help AI agents stay focused by asking questions/correcting them when they diverge from the goal.
2. Some form of persistent artifacts helped me track complex investigations
3. The "right" amount of documentation is probably project-specific

## What Worked Well

- **Advanced elicitation techniques** - Exceptional for requirements gathering
- **Agent specialization** - Focused expertise per domain
- **Template structures** - Clear information requirements
- **Flexible workflow** - Could skip agents when appropriate
- **Epic/Story organization** - Clear work breakdown

## Limitations, Workarounds, and Recommendations

The following key limitations were encountered during `BMad` usage:

### 1. Story Status Update Gap

**Issue:** Workflow blocked after PO validation

- SM creates stories with Status: Draft ([`bmad-core/tasks/create-next-story.md#L79`](https://github.com/bmad-code-org/BMAD-METHOD/tree/v4.35.3/bmad-core/tasks/create-next-story.md#L79))
- PO validates but can't change status (not listed as editor in [`bmad-core/templates/story-tmpl.yaml#L31`](https://github.com/bmad-code-org/BMAD-METHOD/tree/v4.35.3/bmad-core/templates/story-tmpl.yaml#L31))
- Dev won't work on Draft stories
- SM has no `*approve-story` command (verified in `bmad-core/agents/sm.md`)

**Workaround:** Manually asked SM to update statuses to "Approved"

**Recommendation:** Add `*approve-story` command to SM agent for proper workflow completion

### 2. Agent Communication Isolation

**Issue:** Agents operate in complete isolation

- PO validation invisible to other agents
- I must relay all information between agents
- No shared context or memory
- Each agent switch requires full context reload

**Workaround:** Added agent handoff prompts to PRD for coordination

**Recommendations:**

- Minimal agent awareness - agents should know others exist
- Give PO approval authority - if validating, should be able to approve

### 3. Workflow Friction Points

**Issue:** While humans orchestrate and can choose workflows, `BMad` creates friction:

- Story status stuck at "Draft" with no approval mechanism
- PRD template assumes immediate Architect handoff ([`bmad-core/templates/prd-tmpl.yaml#L202`](https://github.com/bmad-code-org/BMAD-METHOD/tree/v4.35.3/bmad-core/templates/prd-tmpl.yaml#L202))
- Bug investigations need iterative discovery but templates assume upfront knowledge

**Workaround:** Skipped Architect, went directly to SM for investigation stories

**Recommendation:** Remove workflow blockers - add approval commands, support phased approaches

### 4. Monolithic Documentation Assumption

**Issue:** One giant document per type for entire system

- Brief hardcoded to `docs/brief.md` ([`bmad-core/templates/project-brief-tmpl.yaml#L7`](https://github.com/bmad-code-org/BMAD-METHOD/tree/v4.35.3/bmad-core/templates/project-brief-tmpl.yaml#L7))
- PRD hardcoded to `docs/prd.md` ([`bmad-core/core-config.yaml#L3`](https://github.com/bmad-code-org/BMAD-METHOD/tree/v4.35.3/bmad-core/core-config.yaml#L3))
- Forces all requirements into single massive documents
- Can't separate concerns or work on multiple features in parallel

**Workaround:** Created feature-specific paths (`docs/briefs/[feature-name].md`)

**Recommendations:**

- Support feature-based organization - separate PRDs/Briefs per feature/module
- Add pre-brief phase - standard `docs/ideas/` structure for exploration

### 5. Story Naming Implementation Gap

**Issue:** Generic filenames provide no context

- Template defines: `{{epic_num}}.{{story_num}}.{{story_title_short}}.md` ([`bmad-core/templates/story-tmpl.yaml#L7`](https://github.com/bmad-code-org/BMAD-METHOD/tree/v4.35.3/bmad-core/templates/story-tmpl.yaml#L7))
- Implementation hardcodes: `{epicNum}.{storyNum}.story.md` ([`bmad-core/tasks/create-next-story.md#L78`](https://github.com/bmad-code-org/BMAD-METHOD/tree/v4.35.3/bmad-core/tasks/create-next-story.md#L78))
- Results in: `/stories/1.1.story.md` with no feature identification and unnesary suffix - it's already in the story folders. Should be configurable.

**Workaround:** None - requires patching `BMad` internals

**Recommendation:** Enable story naming configuration - allow patterns like `[feature]-[epic].[story]-[title].md`

### 6. Missing Cross-references

**Issue:** Templates don't link related documents

- PRD doesn't reference source Brief
- No links between related artifacts

**Workaround:** Manually added Source Brief and analysis links

**Recommendation:** Add cross-references in templates - PRD should link to Brief, Architecture to relevant docs

### 7. Coordination Mechanism

**Issue:** No central coordination between agents

- Architecture template mentions "Begin story implementation with Dev agent" but lacks SM handoff
- No awareness of current feature/task context

**Workaround:** Added multiple handoff prompts to PRD (SM Prompt, PO Prompt, Dev Prompt)

**Recommendation:** Create coordination mechanism - shared context that travels between agents

### 8. Dev Agent Story Selection Logic

**Issue:** Dev agent has no logic for story selection when no argument provided

- When given `*develop-story` without arguments, picks arbitrary story (1.4)
- Doesn't check for unimplemented stories in sequence (1.1, 1.2, 1.3 existed)
- No prompt to user asking which story to implement

**Workaround:** I must specify exact story filename

**Recommendation:** Dev agent should either work stories in order or ask when no argument given

### 9. Dev Agent Document Following

**Issue:** Dev agent ignores critical reference documents

- Story 1.1 contained explicit link to technical analysis
- Proceeded without reading referenced documentation
- Missed crucial context about system architecture and root cause

**Workaround:** I must prompt agent to read specific documents

**Recommendation:** Dev agent should automatically follow all referenced documents in stories

### 10. Dev Agent Checklist Execution

**Issue:** Dev agent workflow awareness but no execution capability

- Workflow specifies "run the task execute-checklist for the checklist story-dod-checklist"
- Agent acknowledges checklist requirement but then ignores it
- Attempts to mark tasks complete WITHOUT running checklist
- `execute-checklist` not available in dev agent's command set
- Doesn't know it's responsible for checklist until user forces investigation

**Workaround:** I must block completion, force agent to discover responsibility, then manually execute

**Recommendation:** Add `execute-checklist` to dev agent commands and enforce checklist execution

## Core Issues

The two fundamental problems with `BMad` v4.35.3:

1. **No central coordination point** - No task tracking or decision mechanism to coordinate agents. I become the workflow engine.

2. **No feature-driven approach** - Everything assumes one monolithic system (one Brief, one PRD, one Architecture). This prevents trunk-based development with parallel features.

## Conclusion

`BMad` `v4.35.3` has exceptional brainstorming and elicitation techniques and specialized agents. However, its assumptions create friction for both greenfield and existing projects - all documentation is system-wide rather than feature-based.

The agent isolation problem isn't unique to `BMad` - it's a challenge the entire industry is tackling. But `BMad` could introduce a "feature" concept to coordinate agents and enable parallel work streams.

The Dev agent implementation revealed additional issues with command parsing, document following, and task execution that further complicate the workflow.

Despite limitations, `BMad` provides value when constraints are understood and worked around. The elicitation techniques alone make it worth exploring.

## Updates

This turned into a longer case study than expected. If this isn't the right place for detailed feedback, happy to move it elsewhere or remove completely :-D

**2025-08-17 (Part 1)**: Added Dev (James) Implementation Journey section documenting critical errors discovered during story development:

- Wrong story selection logic
- Ignoring technical analysis references  
- Checklist execution failures
- Added corresponding limitations #8-10 for Dev agent issues

**2025-08-17 (Part 2)**: Added Story 1.2 command execution failure where Dev agent fabricated disk usage data (160GB instead of actual 54GB) when `nix-store-size` command timed out. The issue is mostly likely related to Claude Code rather than to Bmad, but decided to keep it as a part for of the journey.

**2025-08-17 (Part 3)**: Added Story 1.3 section documenting two key discoveries:

- Dev agent getting carried away with investigation and forgetting the main goal (reproducing the bug)
- The importance of self-contained investigation reports vs scattered temp file references
- Added recommendations for goal reminders and investigation artifact patterns in BMad

**2025-08-17 (Part 4)**: Revised for clarity - changed "User" to first person throughout, fixed inconsistent voice, added disclaimer about unconventional usage, and philosophical note about documentation balance in AI workflows
