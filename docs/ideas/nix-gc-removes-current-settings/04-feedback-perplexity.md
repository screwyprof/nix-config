##  Nix Auto-GC Removing User Settings - Perplexity Analysis


Your analysis of the Nix auto-gc user settings removal problem is thorough and matches both upstream docs and user experiences. The essential findings are supported by the Nix manual, GitHub issues, and the broader community. Here’s a fact-checked review, explanation of the probable mechanism, and suggestions that specifically reflect best practices and real-world user reports.

## Fact Check Against Official and Community Sources

- **System vs User Garbage Collection:**  
  It’s confirmed in the Nix reference manual and by multiple users that system (root) GC and user GC *do not* operate on the same set of profile roots. System GC (`sudo nix-collect-garbage`) removes roots under `/nix/var/nix/profiles`, while user GC (`nix-collect-garbage` without sudo) acts on `~/.local/state/nix/profiles` (with XDG).[5][7][9]
  - This aligns with your observation that "user GC cleans user profiles; system GC cleans system profiles."[5]

- **GC Removal Mechanism:**  
  The `--delete-older-than` flag can remove *generations*, which then allows the actual underlying Nix store paths to be GC’d if nothing else is rooted.[9]
  - Removing a profile or its generations *removes the root*—which means the store GC can collect those paths.  
  - If your prompt/p10k settings or configs are **symlinked** to ephemeral Nix store paths, and those generations are removed, the symlinks break.[9]

- **Known macOS Permission Issues:**  
  The permission, chmod, and chflags issues on macOS are discussed extensively (see e.g. NixOS/nix#6765, NixOS/nix#8508).  
  - GC errors due to permissions sometimes prevent deletion but not always—in some context (root/launchd), GC may succeed in deleting store items, especially if Full Disk Access is missing.[7]

- **Autmatic GC and Launch Context:**  
  Numerous users observe differences between manual and automatic GC: if launchd/systemd jobs run GC as root with different environment or permissions, they may be able to remove files that the interactive user could not.[7][5]
  - In macOS SIP environments, the launchd context often has broader or different permissions than a regular Terminal session, which may explain the discrepancy.

- **Home-manager and Profile Roots:**  
  Home-manager (HM) keeps symlinks to generations (in XDG or legacy locations). If the *roots for a generation* (the symlink) are removed, following GC, associated store paths are considered dead and can be deleted.[7][9]
  - If a symlink in `.config/zsh` or similar points into a path in the Nix store that becomes GC’d, the settings are lost.

***

## What’s Likely Happening

- **Root Cause Inference**:  
  After weekly auto-GC (run as root via launchd), store paths that are the *target of user config symlinks* (p10k, zsh) are unrooted and deleted—even though manual root GC never does this.  
  - This suggests auto-GC, in your setup, is either (1) forking a user context for each user and running user GC (not the default, but misconfiguration is possible), or (2) the launchd root GC can clean files that normal sudo sessions cannot due to different permissions.[9][7]

- **Broken Symlinks and Lost Configs:**  
  As soon as the store path is GC’d, your symlink becomes dangling, and p10k/zsh will revert to default or ask to reconfigure.

## Suggestions for Next Steps and Workarounds

**1. Inspect Automatic GC Launchd Definition:**  
   - Check the launchd plist for `org.nixos.nix-gc`. See if it contains commands or script logic that enumerate or act on user profiles (e.g., iterating all users and running 'nix-collect-garbage' as them).
   - Ensure it isn’t running both system and user-level GC. If it is, that explains why user store paths are GC’d.[7]

**2. Protect Important Generations (“Pinning”):**  
   - Nix does not offer first-class "pinning" of store paths, but you can create a script to add a manual GC root (via `nix-store --add-root`) pointing to critical configs.
   - See: Nix manual’s advice on GC roots and retaining important derivations.[9]

**3. Conversion to Import/Include vs Symlink:**  
   - Where possible, avoid symlinking config files directly into the Nix store. Instead, use `home.file` to copy or install them as regular files into user-writable space.
   - This prevents user data (prompts, secrets, etc.) from being lost when symlink targets disappear.

**4. Full Disk Access / Permissions:**  
   - Grant "Full Disk Access" to Terminal/iTerm2 in macOS privacy settings.[1]
   - This often resolves "permission denied during GC" but also forces caution: with more access, unwanted deletion becomes possible.

**5. Diagnostic: Manual vs Launchd GC:**  
   - Manually run `sudo nix-collect-garbage --delete-older-than 30d` and observe if settings are lost. If not, the issue is launchd context (env, home mounts, permissions).

**6. Audit Nix/GC/Launchd logs:**  
   - Increase GC and launchd debug logging. Look for evidence a user session is running as part of system GC, or for evidence of store path deletion during auto-GC that doesn't occur during manual runs.

**7. Limit Generations, Use home-manager’s Option:**  
   - Limit the number of home-manager generations (`home.extraProfiles.maxGenerations`) to prevent accidental pruning of all user configs.

## Real User Experiences & Workarounds

- Real users confirm that "sudo nix-collect-garbage" does not clean user store or profile roots, but automation tools—and sometimes quirks in Home-Manager or orphaned GC roots—can lead to user settings loss unless GC management is configured per-user as well.[5][7]
- Many report switching Home-Manager to "copy" mode for sensitive configs.[7]

## References to Guidance & Solutions

- Nix manual on `nix-collect-garbage` options and consequences: deletion of generations makes store objects eligible for collection.[9]
- Real user experience distinguishing system and user GC, and how running both is necessary for full clean-up—but also risky if symlinks are active.[5]
- Known issues with systemd/launchd GC jobs, especially those that attempt to run user GC, on the NixOS discourse and GitHub issues.[1][7]

**Summary:**  
You have established, with correct reasoning, that GC only deletes what is unreferenced in the profiles/roots. If your shells/configs depend on store paths not firmly rooted (or if those are only rooted by profiles that get pruned), they will disappear. The apparent difference between manual and automatic GC is likely due to a launchd context that can (a) see and clean user data as root, or (b) runs scripts that operate as the user by design or accident.[5][7][9]

Check your launchd job, avoid symlinking user configs from the Nix store, and consider pinning or copying critical config files. Grant Full Disk Access only with care.[1][5][7][9]
