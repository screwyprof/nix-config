# nix-config Project Brief

*Living document - last updated while actively editing it with Claude!*

## What & Why

**Problem**: Setting up new dev machines is tedious and error-prone. Installing 50+ tools, recreating years of customizations, dealing with version conflicts between projects. Every setup takes 4-8 hours and something is always forgotten.

**Solution**: This nix-config uses Nix flakes to make my entire system reproducible. One command sets up everything exactly how I like it. Projects get isolated environments via `direnv + nix`, so no more "works on my machine" issues.

**Reality Check**: I only set up 2-3 new machines per year, but I switch between projects daily. The real win is seamless project environment switching and fearless experimentation.

## Architecture

```
flake.nix
├── hosts/darwin/         # Machine-specific configs
│   ├── macbook/          # Main M2 machine
│   └── parallels-vm/     # Testing VM
├── home/
│   ├── modules/shared/   # Cross-platform stuff
│   ├── modules/darwin/   # macOS-specific
│   └── users/darwin/     # Per-user configs
└── pkgs/                 # Custom packages
```

**Core Stack**:
- `nix-darwin`: System-level macOS configuration
- `home-manager`: User environment management  
- `nix-homebrew`: GUI apps via Homebrew
- `flakes`: Reproducible, modern Nix

**Design**: Three-tier module system keeps things DRY. Target: 80% shared modules, 20% host-specific. XDG-compliant paths. Immutable Homebrew taps via flake inputs. No secrets in configs.

## What's Included

**CLI Tools** (50+):
- Modern replacements: `eza` (ls), `bat` (cat), `fd` (find), `ripgrep` (grep)
- Shell: ZSH with ZIM framework, Powerlevel10k prompt
- Dev tools: Git with delta, fzf everywhere, direnv
- Custom packages: `alias-teacher` (helps learn my own aliases), `mysides` (Finder sidebar management)

**Development Environments**:
- Go/Rust dev shells in `dev/` (unused - I create per-project flakes)
- Claude shell (experimental MCP integration via .envrc)
- Project isolation via `direnv + flake.nix` (this is the real magic)
- Pre-commit hooks, formatters, linters

**System Features**:
- TouchID for sudo
- Weekly garbage collection
- Unified theming (base24/base16)
- Automated updates via `nix-update` alias

**Via Homebrew** (nix-homebrew manages these):
- GUI apps: browsers, Slack, Discord, etc.
- macOS-specific: Rectangle, Bartender, etc.
- Anything that works better with Homebrew

## Honest Trade-offs

**Accepted**:
- 🗄️ 50GB Nix store → Complete reproducibility
- 🧩 High complexity → But AI makes it manageable now
- 🍎 macOS-only → Optimized for what I actually use
- ⏰ Some maintenance time → Worth it for daily productivity
- 🚀 ~10min rebuilds → Acceptable for full system updates

**Rejected**:
- Cross-platform purity (Linux support is scaffolded but unused)
- Team-friendly (this is MY config, use at your own risk)
- Minimal/simple (I want all my tools configured perfectly)

## Commands I Actually Use

```bash
# System management
nix-rebuild-host      # Rebuild current machine (macbook)
nix-rebuild-mac       # Rebuild parallels VM
nix-check            # Run flake checks + pre-commit hooks
nix-update           # Update all flake inputs
nix-fmt              # Format Nix files
nix-cleanup          # Garbage collect + optimize

# Development
dev go               # Go dev shell (never used)
dev rust             # Rust dev shell (never used) 
dev claude           # Claude + MCP servers (testing)

# Reality: I just create flake.nix per project
# Just cd into any project with flake.nix and direnv does the rest
```

## Current Pain Points

1. **Project initialization**: Still manually creating `flake.nix` for each project despite having examples
2. **Nix store size**: 50GB is hefty, haven't investigated optimization
3. **Documentation**: Future me will forget why I added things

## Future Explorations

**Near-term Experiments**:
- **Dev shells usage**: Actually try using `dev go/rust` for 3rd party projects without Nix
- **Better templates**: Since I create flake.nix for every project anyway:
  - Extract common patterns
  - Build real `nix flake init` templates
  - Stop reinventing the wheel each time
- **Simplify configs**: Test dotfiles for simple configs (.gitconfig etc)
- **Documentation**: Add decision comments inline when adding tools

**Configuration Chronicle** (The interesting part):
- **Config DNA Analysis**: 
  ```bash
  # Parse shell history for actual usage
  history | awk '{print $1}' | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn
  # Track which aliases get used vs ignored
  # Monthly report: "You haven't used X in 6 months"
  ```
- **Decision Journal** (`decisions.md`):
  ```markdown
  ## 2024-01-15: Added lazygit
  Trigger: Complex rebase took 30min
  Why: Interactive UI beats CLI for conflicts
  Impact: Rebases now ~5min
  ```
- **Usage Patterns**: Which tool combinations always appear together?

**Architecture Questions**:
- Is three-tier module system overkill? Try flatter structure
- Can we reduce Nix evaluation time?
- Bridge system config ↔ project configs better

**Maybe Someday**:
- Shared Nix store between host/VMs (save space)
- Linux support (keep architecture ready, just in case)
- Extract alias-teacher as standalone project

## Lessons Learned

1. **Complexity creeps**: Each tool integration led to another
2. **Documentation matters**: Git commits aren't enough context
3. **Perfection trap**: Some things are good enough
4. **AI changes everything**: Nix complexity less scary with Claude/GPT - this is THE game changer that makes Nix viable for personal use

## Technical Choices Worth Remembering

- **ZIM over Oh-My-Zsh**: Performance matters when you live in the terminal
- **nix-darwin + home-manager**: System + user separation is worth the complexity
- **direnv**: The magic that makes project switching seamless
- **Weekly GC**: Automated via launchd, keeps store from growing infinitely

## Risks & Mitigations

**What could break**:
- macOS updates changing security → Nix community will adapt
- Nix ecosystem churn → Pin known-good versions
- Tool abandonment → Find alternatives or remove

**When returning after time away**:
1. Read this doc first
2. Check `decisions.md` for context
3. `git log --oneline` for recent changes
4. Ask AI to explain confusing Nix expressions

## Key Decisions & Why

**Why Nix over dotfiles/scripts**: 
- "In the past I had rust, golang, haskell globally installed, now I can pick the right tools for the right project" - Project isolation is THE killer feature
- Daily value: "I just cd to the project and direnv + nix will do the rest"

**Why accept the complexity**:
- "It made my life easier... too time consuming to set up the environment and make it eye-pleasing and functionally rich"
- The 100+ hours are already spent and paid back
- AI tools now make debugging Nix approachable

**Why this architecture**:
- Modular approach allows future Linux support "without drastic changes"
- Three tiers emerged naturally from refactoring, not over-engineering
- "I patched a lot of tools to my taste" - customization matters

**Why document decisions**:
- "Maybe a good idea... to capture thought process"
- Git commits aren't enough - need the "why"
- Future me needs context, not just code

## Real Talk

This project is **constantly evolving**. It works brilliantly for my needs. Yes, it's complex. Yes, it took 100+ hours to build. But it makes daily development a joy and lets me experiment fearlessly.

Future work should focus on:
- Simplifying what's already there
- Documenting the "why" not just the "what"  
- Measuring actual tool usage (Config DNA)
- Better project initialization (stop recreating flakes)
- Resisting feature creep (but embracing useful evolution)

Remember: This serves daily productivity, not architectural purity.
